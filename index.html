  <h3>What's all this then?</h3>
  <p>You're looking at - and hopefully listening to - a WebAssembly port of my new virtual instrument synth, Chonker.
  It's inspired and influenced by analogue classics, and named in honour of my cat and rubberduck-debugging-assistant.</p>
  <p>It's a fully-featured VA subtractive synth with a production-grade audio engine. It'll connect to your default MIDI input device via WebMIDI - try it and let me know how you get on.</p>  
  <ul>
    <li>Supported browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge. <small>(Sorry, no Safari due to its lack of WebMIDI - <a href="https://jazz-soft.net/">this</a> may help, untested.)</small></li>
    <li>Supported CPUs: Anything capable of running WASM SIMD - Apple Silicon, Intel/AMD x64, ARMv8. <small>Running on something more exotic? Do let me know.</small></li>
    <li>Audio engine: 4x oversampled, fully SIMD vectorised. A thing of beauty. <small><em>though I do say so myself.</em></small></li>
    <li>Oscillators: Standard, supersaw, SUB and various other goodies. Aliasing-free CLIO waveforms. <small><em>If you've seen my ADC2025 talk, those ones. Want to collab on a DAFx paper? HMU.</em></small></li>
    <li>Filters: 0DF circuit modeled. "American", "Japan", SVFs... various circuits and response curves. <small><em>32 of these at 4x in a browser? Yes, it turns out we in fact can. So why not.</em></small></li>
    <li>Effects: Multimode polyphonic FX and master effects chain. <small><em>Not intended to set the world on fire. Hopefully nor your computer either. But some nice original tones you won't normally get from a subtractive VA.</em></small></li>
  </ul>
  <p>There's no front-end on this Web version yet - I need to port that from native code to JS. Watch this space....</p>
  <p>I've built this version with 64 presets included. The real thing has more.</p>  
  <p>The full plug-in will be available to buy in 2026 - I've been working on it for a while, but there are still some finishing touches needed.</p>
  <p>If you're interested in licensing the engine for your desktop, mobile or Web-based project, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angusfx/">get in touch.</a></p>
  <p>Enjoy it!</p>
